captcha-cat
===========

Pulls pictures of cute animals from the PetFinders API. User chooses which pictures are cats to pass a captcha test

This simple project started as a challenge between me and a Microsoft co-worker to see who could implement the most lovable captcha system for a Windows Azure external API consuming project over a weekend. I utilized the PetFinders API in my project to show your favorite furry friends. The user chooses all the pictures that correspond to cats to prove they are human.
